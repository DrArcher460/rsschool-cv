        <p><span class="mail">About myself:</span> Main goal for me is to learn something new and interesting in the technical field. Not so long ago I came across programming and it attracted me so much that I decided to study it on my own, despite the fact that this activity has nothing to do with my current education. Today I'm just starting to learn web-programming and every day it becomes more and more interesting to me this field of activity. Perhaps in the future I will be able to combine together two areas of interest to me (hydrogeological research and programming) and create something new and useful for society.</p>
        <p><span class="mail">Skills:</span> Knowledge of Microsoft Office, blind dialing method.</p>
        <p><span class="mail">Education:</span> Student of Ural State Mining University, specialty: applied Geology.</p>
