3. Main goal for me is to learn something new and interesting in the technical field. 
Not so long ago I came across programming and it attracted me so much that I decided to study it on my own, despite the fact that this activity has nothing to do with my current education. 
Today I'm just starting to learn web-programming and every day it becomes more and more interesting to me this field of activity. 
Perhaps in the future I will be able to combine together two areas of interest to me (hydrogeological research and programming) and create something new and useful for society.
